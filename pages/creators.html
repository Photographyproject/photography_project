<p> I'm Amulya and I'm a rising senior in the Seattle area! Although I only recently took up this hobby, I love portrait photography and everything about it. I also have other interests, such as tennis, design, and penguins! It's been a great experience to be a part of this group since I got to integrate my passion for photography within a coding project. </p>

<p> hello! my name is kiswa and i am a rising senior.i love making new friends and connecting with people. fashion, photography and harry potter are just a few of my passions but i'm down with pretty much anything. if you show any interest in kpop you can be that we will be great friends. i was born in kirkland but my parents are pakistani so i am proud to consider myself a pakistani american. one of my hobbies is photography and when i started out, everything was very overwhelming so i am happy to be a part of a project to make something that would help others out and not make photography a daunting thing! </p>

<p>Hey! I'm 17 years old from Washington State born and raised. I'm a proud Puerto Rican and Mexican American. Fun fact about me is if I could have any superpower it would be of elasticity. Imagine the the mom (AKA Elastigirl) from the Incredibles lol. I'm into learning about all types of things no matter how weird or irrelevant. I love all types of art, so in being a co-creator of this website I hope to continue learning and advocating for anyone and everyone to enjoy visual art. </p>
