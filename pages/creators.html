<p> I'm Amulya and I'm a rising senior in the Seattle area! Although I only recently took up this hobby, I love <br>portrait photography and everything about it. I also have other interests, such as <br>tennis, design, and penguins! It's been a great experience to be a part of this group since <br>I got to integrate my passion for photography within a coding project. </p>

<p> hello! my name is kiswa and i am a rising senior.i love making new friends and connecting with people.<br> fashion, photography and harry potter are just a few of my passions but i'm down with pretty much <br> anything. if you show any interest in kpop you can be that we will be great friends.<br> i was born in kirkland but my parents are pakistani so i am proud to consider myself a pakistani <br>american. one of my hobbies is photography and when i started out, everything was very overwhelming <br>so i am happy to be a part of a project to make something that would help others out and not make<br> photography a daunting thing! </p>

<p>Hi I’m Ileyna and I’m a rising senior and I go to Kentridge High school. I was born in Renton and have lived here all my life I’ve been playing the violin for 6 years but recently last year I stopped because I took an interest in computer science. I have always had a passion to learn about Computer Science mostly because of my Dad who would always buys the latest games and take me to to PAX with him. applying to Girls Who Code was honestly one of the best decisions I’ve ever made because it made me feel inspired, determined, and definitely more group friendly. Before Girls Who Code my career path was aiming more towards the science/ S.T.E.M field jobs-such as galactic scientist, blood splatter Analyst to an astronomer. Seattle is one of my favorite places to go with my friends when i have free time. </p>

<p>Hey! I'm 17 years old from Washington State, born and raised. I'm a proud Puerto Rican and Mexican American. <br>Fun fact about me is if I could have any superpower it would be of elasticity. Imagine the the mom <br>(AKA Elastigirl) from the Incredibles lol. I'm into learning about all types of things no matter how weird <br>or irrelevant. I love all types of art, so in being a co-creator of this website I hope to <br>continue learning and advocating for anyone and everyone to enjoy visual art. </p>
